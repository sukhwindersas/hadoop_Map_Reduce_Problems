To find frequencies of letters [a-z] in a huge text of few GBs, do you need Map/Reduce?

Yes, We do need Map/Reduce to find out the frequencies.
 input 
 echo 'this is myword and list
 
 Map will be =====  sed 's/\(.\)/\1 /g' |sed -r 's/[ ]+/\n/g' |sort -S 1g 
 
 Explaination --- First sed will split word into the letters seperated by space
              --- Second sed will replace spaces with the new line
              --- third sort will sort in acessending order with 1gb memory
 Reduce will be ==== uniq -c
              --- uniq -c will count the each occurence.
