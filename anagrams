Find anagrams in a huge text. An anagram is basically a different arrangement of letters in a word. Anagram does not need to be meaningful.

Input:
“the cat act in tic tac toe.”

Output: 
cat, tac, act

We can solve this problem using hadoop streaming.

funcMapper(key,value)
{
key=sort word alphabetically 
value=word
}


funcReducer(key,value)
{
sort on key and combine all values togther.

}
